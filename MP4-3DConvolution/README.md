# MP-4 3D Convolution

## Objective

The purpose of this lab is to implement a 3D convolution using constant memory for the kernel and 3D shared memory tiling. 

## Instructions

- Edit the code to implement a 3D convolution with a 3x3x3 kernel in constant memory and a 3D shared-memory tiling.

- Edit the code to launch the kernel you implemented. The function should launch 3D CUDA grid and blocks, where each thread is responsible for computing a single element of the output.

- Answer the questions found in the questions tab.
