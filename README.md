# AppliedParallelProgramming
The course involves 8 programming lab assignments of steadily growing complexity. All assignments will involve programming a massively parallel GPU system using CUDA, which is a popular commercial language extension of C/C++ for GPU programming.  Assignments involve tasks such as matrix multiplication, convolution, reduction, histogramming, and sparse matrix-vector multiplication. During the final third of the semester, students work on a larger, more complex project/competition.
