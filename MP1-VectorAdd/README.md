# MP1-VectorAdd 

## Objective 
The purpose of this lab is to get you familiar with using the CUDA API by implementing a simple vector addition kernel and its associated host code as shown in the lectures. 

## Instruction
Edit the code to perform the following:

- Allocate device memory

- Copy host memory to device

- Initialize thread block and kernel grid dimensions

- Invoke CUDA kernel

- Copy results from device to host

- Free device memory

- Write the CUDA kernel
